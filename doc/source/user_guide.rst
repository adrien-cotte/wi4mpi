Introduction
============

MPI is a standard in HPC community which allows a simple use of
clusters. Nowoaday, there are several implementation (OpenMPI, BullxMPI,
MPT, IntelMPI, MPC, ...) each of which involves a specific ABI
(Application Binary Interface) for an application compiled with a
specific MPI implementation. With wi4mpi, an application compiled with
an alpha MPI implementation can be run under a beta MPI implementation
without any compilation protocol and any concern about the ABI (Preload
version). WI4MPI can also be seen as a dedicated MPI implementation;
This time, the application is compiled against the wi4mpi library
(libmpi.so) whith the dedicated wrapper (mpicc,mpif90...) meant for that
purpose, and can be run under any other MPI implementation (Interface
Version).

Installation
============

The installation procedureis simply consists of a cmake make install
sequence.

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir BUILD ; cd BUILD
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir ..
    make
    make install

CMAKE specific variables
-------------------------

-  WI4MPI\_COMPILER:string

   Indicate which compilateur is used to compiled WI4MPI. Possible
   options: INTEL(default), GNU, PGI, LLVM, ARMCLANG, FUJITSU

-  OPENMPI\_ROOT
   
   Open MPI root dir, put in wi4mpi.cfg, could be added
   manually, optionnal value. This variable is required for Testing, one
   must add -DOPENMPI\_ROOT=/path/to/openmpi option.

-  INTELMPI\_ROOT
   
   Intel MPI root dir, put in wi4mpi.cfg, could be added
   manually, optionnal value.

-  MPC\_ROOT
   
   MPC root dir, put in wi4mpi.cfg, could be added manually,
   optionnal value.

-  MPICH\_ROOT
   
   MPICH root dir, put in wi4mpi.cfg, could be added
   manually, optionnal value.

-  WI4MPI\_RELEASE

   Indicate the Wi4MPI state set for the installation:

    - DEBUG: -DDEBUG is provided to activate some debug information. Useful for WI4MPI and applications developer.
    - NORMAL: -g is provided
    - RELEASE: -g is not provided

Both version (interface and preload) of wi4mpi are compiled and
installed into the CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX directory provided during the
cmake initialisation.

Usage
=====

As said in the introduction WI4MPI can be use with two different modes:

- INTERFACE

    The application is compiled using the mpi wrapper available
    within WI4MPI

        - Interface -> OpenMPI 
        - Interface -> IntelMPI 
        - Interface -> MPICH/MVAPICH 
        - Interface -> MPC 

- PRELOAD

    The application is compiled using the mpi
    wrapper available within common MPI Implementation Several conversions
    can be performed by wi4mpi.

        - Interface -> OpenMPI 
        - Interface -> IntelMPI 
        - Interface -> MPICH/MVAPICH 
        - Interface -> MPC 
        - OpenMPI -> OpenMPI 
        - OpenMPI -> IntelMPI 
        - OpenMPI -> MPICH/MVAPICH 
        - OpenMPI -> MPC 
        - IntelMPI -> OpenMPI 
        - IntelMPI -> IntelMPI 
        - IntelMPI -> MPICH/MVAPICH 
        - IntelMPI -> MPC 
        - MPICH/MVAPICH -> OpenMPI 
        - MPICH/MVAPICH -> IntelMPI 
        - MPICH/MVAPICH -> MPICH/MVAPICH 
        - MPICH/MVAPICH -> MPC

Quick start
-----------

WI4MPI dedicated launcher available in
/path-install/wi4mpi-%version/bin/wi4mpi allow an easy use of the
library. To work, users only have to set the path to the different MPI
implementation installation in
/path-install/wi4mpi-%version/etc/wi4mpi.cfg configuration file.

But, an mpirun command is also provided for more use.

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: mpirun [MPIRUN_TARGET_OPTIONS] -- [PROGRAM] [PROGRAM_OPTIONS]
    Advanced options:
        -F | -from | --from {FROM}      The MPI implentation from which PROGRAM was compiled with
        -T | -to | --to {TARGET}        The MPI implentation to which PROGRAM will be run

    The -F FROM option is optionnal. If not provided, the interface mode is choosen.

Example

.. code-block:: console

    mpirun -np 4 -F openmpi -T intelmpi mpi_hello.exe

In this exemple wi4mpi understand that mpi_hello.exe is a binary file compiled with OpenMPI, which is run under IntelMPI.

TGCC integration
----------------

WI4MPI is available on the TGCC via its module environment. All the
environment settings detailed in the next section is hide by a system of
flavor and features specific to the center. The flavor indicates the
kind of the installation choosen by the users, on the other hand, the
features are used to set one of the choosen conversion we highlight in
the previous section.

(Flavors et features are modulefiles) Concerning the flavors:

::

    - flavor/wi4mpi/{installation_type} : {installation_type} can be debug or standard

Concerning the features:

::

    - feature/wi4mpi/to/{MPI}/{version} : indicates the desired MPI version for the runtime ({MPI} can take two value OpenMPI or IntelMPI).
    - feature/wi4mpi/from/{MPI}/{version} : indicates the MPI version used to compiled the binary ELF file ({MPI} can take two value OpenMPI or IntelMPI). This features is not prerequisites, if not loaded (which is the default behaviour), the user is using WI4MPI in the interface.

Default behavior example:

::

    $ module load mpi/wi4mpi/%version
    load module flavor/wi4mpi/standard (wi4mpi flavor)                                                  #Default installation is standard
    load module feature/wi4mpi/to/openmpi/1.8.8 (WI4MPI feature to openmpi 1.8.8)                       #Default conversion is Interface -> OpenMPI/1.8.8 (since no module feature/wi4mpi/from is loaded, the wi4mpi mode is interface)
    load module feature/wi4mpi/mpi_compiler/intel (Wi4MPI compiler feature)                             #Default compilator use by mpi wrapper (mpicc,mpicxx,mpif90,...) within WI4MPI are Intel compilers
    load module wi4mpi/3.3.0 (Wi4MPI with openmpi/1.8.8)

    In this example, WI4MPI assume that the application is compiled with its own library libmpi.so

    To simply change the conversion "module switch feature/wi4mpi/to/intelmpi/2017"

To activate the preload mode example:

::

    $ module load mpi/wi4mpi/%version
    $ module load feature/wi4mpi/from/intelmpi/2017
    load module feature/wi4mpi/from/intelmpi/2017 (WI4MPI feature from intelmpi 2017)

WI4MPI features
---------------

Default Conversion Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During compilation time of the application, users are able to set a
default conversion using WI4MPI compiling wrapper by providing the
-wi4mpi\_default\_run\_path option.

example:

    mpicc -wi4mpi\_default\_run\_path OMPI hello.c -o hello

Two values can be passed with -wi4mpi\_default\_run\_path:

    - OMPI : set the default conversion to \_INTEL
    - IMPI : set the default conversion to \_OMPI

The runtime MPI library used is the ones referenced in the
etc/wi4mpi.cfg file, but be aware that they can be overided using the
WI4MPI\_RUN\_MPI\_C\_LIB, and WI4MPI\_RUN\_MPI\_F\_LIB environment
variables as follow.

    WI4MPI\_RUN\_MPI\_C\_LIB="/path" WI4MPI\_RUN\_MPI\_F\_LIB="/path" mpicc -wi4mpi\_default\_run\_path OMPI hello.c -o hello

When the environment is set, the default conversion is not taken in
account.

Static Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a static mode in wi4mpi : this mode need to use the interface header and link to libmpi.a. All conversion are embedded and two environement variable specify the conversion type : WI4MPI_STATIC_TARGET_TYPE_F for fortran conversion and WI4MPI_STATIC_TARGET_TYPE for C/C++ conversion; supported value are : OMPI and INTEL.

Use is the following

    set WI4MPI_RUN_MPI_C_LIB,WI4MPI_RUN_MPI_F_LIB to respective target library
    set WI4MPI_STATIC_TARGET_TYPE,WI4MPI_STATIC_TARGET_TYPE_F to conversion typeaccording to target library.
    run executable.

Extended Debug Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As seen before, one is able to compile Wi4MPI with debug symbols thanks
to "-DWI4MPI\_REALEASE=DEBUG". Moreover, this setting enable an extended
debug mode. This feature allow to select any MPI function and print
input/ouput values after each call. One can select functions with
"WI4\_debug=1" environment variable (WI4MPI\_Init\_debut,
WI4MPI\_Allreduce\_debug...).

Examples:

::

    $ mpirun -n 1 ./hello
    You are using Wi4MPI-3.3.0a with the mode interface From Interface To OpenMPI-2.0.4
    Hello from 1/1

    $ WI4MPI_Init_debug=1 mpirun -n 1 ./hello
    You are using Wi4MPI-3.3.0a with the mode interface From Interface To OpenMPI-2.0.4
    MPI_Init :
    {
    argc : 1,
    argv : [
    ./hello.wmpi
    ]
    ,
    error/return : 0
    }
    Hello from 1/1

Debug output print respects JSON format in order to be easily parsed.

Timeout Helper Thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any reason you may want to kill a process which has passed too many
time into a function. Wi4MPI allow you to add a timeout to any MPI
function with "WI4\_timeout=" environment variables
(WI4MPI\_Init\_timeout, WI4MPI\_Allreduce\_timeout...).

Examples:

::

    $ mpirun -n 1 ./hello
    You are using Wi4MPI-3.3.0a with the mode interface From Interface To OpenMPI-2.0.4
    Hello from 1/1

    $ WI4MPI_Init_timeout=1 mpirun -n 1 ./hello
    Wi4MPI error: processus 25572 on host r0login has reached a timeout!
    Aborted

Developers words
================

First of all thanks a lot for using the wi4mpi software. Nevertheless be
aware that this software is still under development and that some bugs
may remain. If you encounter one of them, don't hesitate to contact one
of the authors and so to participate to the software robustness. Second,
wi4mpi is compatible with the 3.1 MPI norm. Don't hesitate to
participate :-)
